The layout was desgined with a mobile first perspective. 
It allows for an easy to view mobile experience.

# Future Developments
Incorporate additional API endpoint calls to allow for search feature of only alcohol type. This will allow for the app to reach a wider audience who may not already know what drink name they'd like to search. 
Additionally allow for non alcholic drinks to be searched for those who so choose.
